                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                The FacultyHack@Gateway2022 will involve five(5) teams of two(2) Computer Science faculty or one(1) Computer Science and one(1) 
                related discipline area faculty are encouraged to submit applications. Faculty will adapt High-Performance Computing (HPC) tools 
                for use in their courses. They will leave with "ready-to-go" course outlines, supporting data, and identified resources. Each team 
                will be assigned a technical mentor to help with this process. Teams completing all three(3) challenges receive a $500(USD) honorarium.
                    <br>
                Check-ins take place the first 20 minutes of each training session to access team progress and provide suggestions for success. During 
                the check-ins, teams will have 2-3 minutes to give their updates.
                </p>
